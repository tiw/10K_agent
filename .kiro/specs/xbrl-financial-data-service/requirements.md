# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a comprehensive Python-based XBRL financial data service that can parse Apple's 10-K filing XBRL documents and expose financial information through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface for LLM agents. The service will extract, process, and serve structured financial data from XBRL taxonomy files including schema definitions, calculation linkbases, definition linkbases, label linkbases, presentation linkbases, and instance documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: XBRL File Parsing and Data Extraction

**User Story:** As a financial analyst or LLM agent, I want to parse XBRL files and extract structured financial data, so that I can access standardized financial information programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives XBRL schema files (.xsd) THEN it SHALL parse the taxonomy structure and extract element definitions
2. WHEN the system receives calculation linkbase files (_cal.xml) THEN it SHALL extract calculation relationships between financial elements
3. WHEN the system receives definition linkbase files (_def.xml) THEN it SHALL parse dimensional relationships and hierarchies
4. WHEN the system receives label linkbase files (_lab.xml) THEN it SHALL extract human-readable labels for financial elements
5. WHEN the system receives presentation linkbase files (_pre.xml) THEN it SHALL parse the presentation structure and ordering
6. WHEN the system receives instance documents (_htm.xml) THEN it SHALL extract actual financial fact values with contexts and periods

### Requirement 2: Financial Data Query Interface

**User Story:** As an LLM agent, I want to query specific financial metrics and statements, so that I can retrieve relevant financial information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying for income statement data THEN the system SHALL return revenue, expenses, and profit metrics with proper calculations
2. WHEN querying for balance sheet data THEN the system SHALL return assets, liabilities, and equity information with hierarchical relationships
3. WHEN querying for cash flow data THEN the system SHALL return operating, investing, and financing cash flows
4. WHEN querying for specific financial ratios THEN the system SHALL calculate and return computed metrics
5. WHEN querying with time periods THEN the system SHALL filter data by fiscal years, quarters, or custom date ranges
6. WHEN querying fails due to missing data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with suggestions

### Requirement 3: MCP Service Integration

**User Story:** As an LLM agent, I want to access financial data through standardized MCP protocol, so that I can integrate financial analysis capabilities seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL expose financial data tools through the MCP protocol
2. WHEN an MCP client requests available tools THEN the system SHALL return a list of financial query capabilities
3. WHEN an MCP client calls a financial tool THEN the system SHALL execute the query and return structured JSON responses
4. WHEN multiple MCP clients connect THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
5. WHEN the MCP server encounters errors THEN it SHALL return standardized error responses with helpful context

### Requirement 4: Data Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to ensure data accuracy and completeness, so that I can trust the financial information provided by the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing XBRL files THEN the system SHALL validate file structure and schema compliance
2. WHEN extracting financial facts THEN the system SHALL verify calculation relationships and flag inconsistencies
3. WHEN serving financial data THEN the system SHALL include metadata about data quality and completeness
4. WHEN detecting data anomalies THEN the system SHALL log warnings and provide context about potential issues
5. WHEN financial calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate results against XBRL calculation linkbases

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, so that it can serve multiple LLM agents simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large XBRL files THEN the system SHALL complete parsing within reasonable time limits (< 30 seconds)
2. WHEN serving concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds for cached data
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to optimize performance
4. WHEN handling multiple file sets THEN the system SHALL support batch processing and parallel execution
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance rather than failing

### Requirement 6: Advanced Financial Analysis - Funnel and Trend Analysis

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to analyze financial data through vertical efficiency funnels and horizontal growth trends, so that I can understand both operational efficiency and growth patterns comprehensively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing vertical efficiency THEN the system SHALL create financial funnels showing conversion rates from revenue → cash flow → profit → equity → capital returns → capital allocation
2. WHEN displaying funnel analysis THEN the system SHALL show conversion rates and margin percentages at each level with drill-down capabilities
3. WHEN performing horizontal analysis THEN the system SHALL calculate growth rates, compound annual growth rates (CAGR), and trend analysis across multiple periods
4. WHEN drilling down into funnel levels THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns by product lines, geographic segments, or expense categories
5. WHEN combining funnel and trend analysis THEN the system SHALL identify efficiency improvements and growth acceleration patterns
6. WHEN visualizing financial funnels THEN the system SHALL provide tree-structured data that can be rendered as hierarchical charts

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the service for different XBRL taxonomies and extend functionality, so that it can adapt to various financial reporting standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the service THEN it SHALL support different XBRL taxonomy versions (US-GAAP, IFRS, etc.)
2. WHEN adding new financial metrics THEN the system SHALL allow custom calculation definitions
3. WHEN integrating with different data sources THEN the system SHALL support pluggable data adapters
4. WHEN deploying in different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration files
5. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide clear APIs for adding new financial analysis capabilities
